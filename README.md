## Hi there, I'm Mykhailo ðŸ‘‹
I was a UI/UX designer, but one day, 5 years ago, I opened VIM and still don't know how to exitâ€”so Iâ€™ve been a full-time developer ever since.

Currently, Iâ€™m working as a software developer at Ericsson.

In my day-to-day work, I use TypeScript, React, Python, and FastAPI.

In my free time, I work on projects with Express, Golang, Next.js, and basically any technology that is new to me and seems interesting.


### My projects

<a href="https://marsogram.web.app">MarsoGram</a>  - Like instagram but for Mars Rovers
